					<h3>About Me</h3>
						<img id="MyPic">
					
						<p>My name is Stuart Schafer, unless I’m in trouble or did something wrong.  In that case, my name is Rudy Gesegnet. I have lived my entire life in the state of North Carolina.  I was born in Fayetteville, NC, aka Fayet-nam, Fay-Ruit, and Bragg-dad. I went to school at Appalachian State in Boone, NC, and then UNC Charlotte.  I met my wonderful, beautiful, smart, amazing, talented, gorgeous wife in Charlotte, NC, and we were married on my birthday (I better not forget our anniversary!).
						</p>

						<p>I’ve worked in Charlotte for the past 17 years mostly in inside sales, tech support, and customer service.  We moved to Cary for a great job opportunity for my wife, and it made sense for me to go back to school to pursue another passion; computer coding.  I am so eager to learn and code to create and bring my ideas to life.  I enjoy most sports, love the UNC Tarheels, Carolina Panthers, and of course my alma mater, ASU Mountaineers. I love to visit places I’ve never been and experience the culture.  When not coding, you can often find me playing video games or Netflixing. We also have 2 adorable furry critters who rule our house; <a id="kitty" href="assets/images/socksandbuffy.jpg">Socks (L) and Buffy (R)</a>. (click on them to see a picture)
